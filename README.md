# Final Reflection: Spectrum Sunglass Simulation

## Overview
This project reflects on the Spectrum Sunglass Simulation, an applied analytics and leadership exercise conducted as part of the APAN 5700 course. The simulation involved leading organizational change under conditions of varying authority and urgency, with a focus on diagnosing the situation, mobilizing stakeholders, and sustaining change.

## Key Components

### Diagnosis
- **Reactive vs. Proactive Change**: Evaluated whether changes were reactive or proactive and identified the gaps they addressedâ€”opportunity or performance.
- **Challenges in Leadership**: Compared the difficulties of leading proactive versus reactive change, particularly in different urgency contexts.

### Change Adoption
- **Mobilization**: Strategies to gain support from key stakeholders, including consultants and the CEO, to build credibility.
- **Movement**: Tactics to maintain momentum through progress reports, goal setting, and coalition-building.
- **Sustainment**: Methods to secure change by reinforcing success stories and maintaining high morale.

### Lessons Learned
- **Effective Timing**: Importance of conducting the right actions at the right time to avoid delays and resistance.
- **Morale Boosting**: The critical role of storytelling and morale-raising in persuading stakeholders to adopt change.
- **Support and Credibility**: The value of securing support from consultants and leadership to validate and reinforce strategic decisions.
